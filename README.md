# Bitwise Binary — Automated Resume Relevance & Feedback System

**24 Hours. 3 Minds. 10+ Features. One Vision.**  
_A Code4Edtech Challenge — 24-Hour Hackathon build by Team Bitwise Binary (Vishwanath Karne, Lokesh, Abbu)._

---

> We built an end-to-end Automated Resume Relevance & Feedback System to give every candidate fast, fair, and actionable resume evaluations — and to make recruitment easier and more consistent for placement and HR teams.

This README documents what we built, why it matters, how it works, how to run it locally (and via Docker), and what’s next.

## Problem Statement
Recruiters and placement teams receive thousands of resumes and must manually shortlist candidates — a process that is slow, inconsistent, and prone to bias. Our tool automates evaluation against job descriptions, outputs a relevance score (0–100), highlights missing skills, and gives personalized feedback to applicants while providing a searchable dashboard for placement teams.

## What We Built (Highlights / Features)

**Core MVP (10+ integrated features)**  
1. **Resume Upload + Parsing** — Accepts PDF / DOCX and extracts normalized text.  
2. **Automated ATS-Style Scoring** — Instant Relevance Score (0–100) per JD.  
3. **Hybrid Scoring Engine** — Hard keyword/skill checks + LLM semantic matching.  
4. **Personalized Resume Feedback** — Actionable tips generated by Python + LLM.  
5. **AI Voice Mentor** — Personalized voice guidance powered by ElevenLabs voice model.  
6. **AI Chatbot (Innomatics AI Chatbot)** — 24/7 assistant for suggestions & Q&A (zapier chat link included).  
7. **Bulk Upload for HR** — HR / placement teams can upload many resumes and auto-match them to JDs.  
8. **Dashboard for Placement Teams** — Search, filter, and review by job role & score.  
9. **Resume Gap Highlighter** — Missing skills/certs/projects listed per resume.  
10. **Export / Shortlist** — Download shortlisted candidate lists or export to CSV.  
11. **User Analytics & Logs** — Track scans, improvements over time, and usage metrics.

## Architecture & How It Works (Technical Flow)

1. **Job Requirement Upload** — Placement team uploads JD (title, must-have, nice-to-have).  
2. **Resume Upload** — Candidate uploads PDF/DOCX → text extraction via PyMuPDF / pdfplumber / python-docx.  
3. **Preprocessing** — Normalize sections (Experience, Education, Skills), remove headers/footers, extract entities with spaCy/NLTK.  
4. **Hard Match** — Keyword & fuzzy matches for explicit skills, education, certifications (TF-IDF / fuzzy / BM25).  
5. **Semantic Match** — Create embeddings (Chroma/FAISS/Pinecone) → compute cosine similarity between resume & JD embeddings.  
6. **Scoring** — Weighted combination: Hard checks + Semantic similarity → final Relevance Score (0–100) and Fit Verdict (High / Medium / Low).  
7. **Feedback Generation** — LLM generates personalized improvement tips (rewording suggestions, missing projects, how to list skills).  
8. **Voice & Chat Assistants** — 11Labs voice model for voice mentor; AI chatbot for 1:1 suggestions and follow-ups.  
9. **Storage & Dashboard** — Results saved to DB and surfaced in a web dashboard for placement teams.

## Run Locally (Quickstart)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/bitwise-binary.git
cd bitwise-binary

# Backend AI Service
cd resume-service
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

# Backend (MERN)
cd ../server
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend
cd ../client
npm install
npm start
```

---

## Run with Docker / Deployment

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
# stop
docker-compose down
```

Example `docker-compose.yml` provided in repo.

---

## Example API Endpoints & Usage

```bash
POST /api/upload        # Upload resume & JD
GET  /api/score/:id     # Fetch stored relevance score
POST /api/bulk-upload   # HR bulk upload
```

Example upload:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/upload"   -F "file=@/path/to/resume.pdf"   -F "job_description=@/path/to/job.txt"
```
